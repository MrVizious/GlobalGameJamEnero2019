# Drunken Sneak

## Story
You are a young teenager who, after a night out of drinking and partying, have to come back home and avoid getting caught red-handed trying to sneak in the house. You are still pretty drunk, too, so you better think very carefully what exactly you are going to do even before getting into the room. If you want to get to your bed without much hassle.

## Gameplay
Everytime you enter a room, you are prompted with a number of actions to do. Any letter of the english alphabet can be used as an input, and it will fill the action list accordingly, and pressing Return executes the actions if the list is completed. WASD is used for movement, while any other letter only works next to certain objects. Any element you can interact with will show the corresponding letter whenever you go next to it, so you can try to see if something can start an action by walking next to it!

## About the Creation of the Game
This game was created during the Global Game Jam held in January of 2019, in the Jam Site of "Florida Universit√†ria". Unfortunately, we didn't quite achieve what we had in mind, but we had lots of fun creating it anyway! Don't really expect much from it, it doesn't even have a proper puzzle and even bugs out in specific times. Who knows, maybe in the future we can implement what we have learned here in order to remake it into something more... complete.
